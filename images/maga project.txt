A detailed system architecture flowchart for a global device tracking software. The flowchart should include:

1. **User Input Layer**: Users enter MAC address, IMEI, or other unique device identifiers.
2. **Data Collection Layer**:
   - Public databases (Shodan, WiGLE, IMEI registries, OSINT sources)
   - ISP & IP logs (MaxMind, IPinfo API)
   - Passive network monitoring (Wi-Fi, cell towers, SDR tracking)
   - Active scanning (probe public Wi-Fi, DNS logs)
3. **Data Processing Layer**:
   - AI-Powered Device Behavior Analysis
   - Correlation engine (matches device activity across sources)
   - Privacy-compliant anonymization
4. **Analysis & Monitoring Layer**:
   - Automated tracking watchlist (continuously scans for device activity)
   - Dark web & stolen device marketplace monitoring
   - Honeypot traps (fake tracking apps to collect thief data)
   - AI-based anomaly detection
5. **Alert & Notification Layer**:
   - Real-time alerts (email, SMS, app notifications) when the device is online
   - Geolocation tracking (Google Maps API)
   - Reporting dashboard for law enforcement or user tracking history

The flowchart should use arrows to show data flow between components, using a high-tech cyber intelligence theme with a futuristic design.
